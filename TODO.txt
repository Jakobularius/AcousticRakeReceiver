Room
----

* Visibility of source from microphone
* Blocking walls (convex hull). A corner can be verified as belonging to convex
  hull by checking the ordering of itself and front and back neighbour (clockwise
  vs anticlockwise)
* Verify if a point is in the polygon or outside (count number of walls intersecting)
* methods 3D rooms not implemented
* Add a 'signal' class that has all the parameters of the signal (sampling
   rate, etc). If possible, have this class extend ndarray so that we can use
   all the standard routines on them. We just want a few extra attributes.
